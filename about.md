This is a blog of tips, tricks, and experiences with using R by me, Simon A Jackson. I'm a cognitive scientist and R enthusiast, currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Cognitive and Decision Sciences (CODES) Research Lab in the School of Psychology, University of Sydney, Australia. At present, my work in funded by the Australia Army to investigate adaptable cognitive and decision making in land-vehicle crews. I'm passionate about psychology, decision making, data analytics, and... R! So this blog mostly consists of methods for data munging and analysing data related to psychological research in R.
